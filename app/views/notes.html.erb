Comments will need to be made on the Post show page.  That's where comments will show and be filled out.

Posts will be generated on the focused page of the conetent: NFL, NBA, LINE MOVEMENTS, General, etc.  There will be a page where the user can select their subject, then they go to the subject's designated page where we can see the thread titles, but also here they can create a new post.

Probes will be shown on the Matchup/edit, Selections on Matchup show.  Two different pages.  Both pages list the active matchups as links.  User clicks on a matchup and then has the option.  On the probe page, have an admin if statement that can show the matchup and allow it to be edited.

	  BETTOR'S NETWORK

	  User Model
	  Matchup Model
	  Selection Model

	  When matchup.score.length != 0 than that means this matchup has been updated.  If updated then it is qualified to be graded to any corresponding selections that hold this matchup's id.

	  The key features of the site:

	  1) Enter Picks Section

	  	This is primarily done.  Users will click a link that brings them to matchups index.  On matchups index is a list of the games sorted by sport.  You click on a matchup and go to matchups show where the selection process is.

	  	Teams, matchups, Pick form, game_id, user_id, a gui option for selecting.  Click om the matchup, and on the matchup show page make a selection and submit it.  Once a selection is made the option to select that option again disappears.  Can select side or total.  Picks will take a user_id and a matchup_id.

	  	Enter Picks has to be fast and easy for the user.  "enter picks homepage" is matchup/index.  That will list all available matchups sorted by sport, each one clickable.  Click on a link and then brought to that matchups homepage where you can select the side or total.  Three clicks and you are done. Won't take long at all.

	  2) Grade Picks - get the records on demand for the community and the current user.  Selection.choice will be compared to Matchup.ats_winner and Matchup.total_result depending if Selection.cat is "Side" or "Total".  So, the data entered into those fields must match what is auomatically entered into the selection.choice field upon click. 

	  	To grade picks we need to get the ATS winner and the ATS total winner from the matchup.  Once we have that, we compare to the selection that shares the id.  We then group winners and losers and get the percetage in each category we track.  Picks are going to be graded where they need to be.  The user's picks will be graded on their profile page, community picks graded in the directory section.

	  3) Create Personal Consensus - allow users to tag anyone they want as a fader or a follower - this will be done on the directory page.  Then display the results of their tags for them on their page.

	  	Users will need to go to a directory that can have two sorting options.  First is sort by sport.  Choose a sport and the page refreshes where you can then choose the situation.  Once the situation is chosen the community list appears from hightest to loswest win % in that category.  Next to the win % will be a fade button and a follow button.  You can hit either one, but once you are fading someone or following someone then what appears is a delete button that says STOP.

	  	As you build your consensus, you can see the results on your profile page.  There is the breakdown of the numbers which will be the results, if any, of the faders/followers you've chosen.  If they have chosen a team that fits the criteria you are fading/following them in then you will be notified.  We should list by what % of the people you are fading/following in a certain category have that game, so if you fade five people in the road +3.5 - +6.5 and two of them have a team that fits the criteria than 40% of the bettors you fade have selected the team.

	  	These are the main three.

	  You land on the home page.  The home page will have to depict what the sight is for(creating a twitter like sports bettors network) and who it is for(the average sports bettor).  On this home page you can sign up - new registration -  or you can login to your account - if an existimg member.  The sign up page can have some additional details to it plus the form.  The login fields themselves will be on the home page.  You log in and you are brought to:

	  Your dashboard.  Your dash will hold your information.  How many people you are following, how many you are fading.  Also who is following you and who is fading you.  Your pick record, maybe community ranking in each category.  Have to make a suggestion to them based on the parameters they set up.  From the dashboard you can get to the picks section

	  Picks Page:  The picks page will hold all the links of the games that are available to be chosen.  They will be sorted by sport.  You click on a game and you can choose either the side or the total.

	  Users have to enter picks all at once.  So it can be done quickly. To do this, on the matchups index page have the selections form.  Matchups appear sorted by sport.  Each matchup is in a square grid with the format: 

	  					Vistor Spread Ovr Spread
	                   	Home Spread Und Spread


	 Users will click on an option.  Once they click an option, that option appears in the box.  Same with totals.  Their options will appear on a side bar and they can change them.

	 Need to let users make selections on the games.  Probably do this in bulk.  Right on the front?  But it can only be seen by those who are logged in.  Maybe take it off the front.  The front maybe should be a landing page, maybe a video tutorial.  Talk about what we do and why.  Explain why it is important.  Once loggin in you can make picks on the matchup index page.  A grid like described above with tabs for each sport.

	 Matchups will be created that include all information about home/away and spread and also a slot for score to game and total.

	 On the search page people will have three layers of filters and then search.  Need a function that loops through users and then loops through users matchups(if in bulk must look through that days selections and pluck off the ones user is looking for) and then isolate any matchups that meet criteria in the filters.  Go through isolated selections and get the win/loss record and percentage.  Order the users by highest to lowest percentage. Each user will appear with a fade or follow button that the user can click.

	 Now on the users profile they will see all the analytics.  First the analytics on them.  How many people are fading them?  How many following them?  In what categories?  Then the analytics on the people that they tagged.  make a grid of the situations then under each put FADE: and FOLLOW: then count each.

	 Can also look up for them if faders and followers disagree in a certain category.  These will be their hot picks and I'd like to save these to see how they do.  I could have them hit a button possibly.  Give them the option of saving the picks, look into saving them automatically if not a button next to each one.

	 Create the grid based on matchups and send info to js and create the grid.  When they make a choice it gets saved to the form: choice, spread, category(what situation?), type(side:totals), matchup id, date.  Maybe have the opportunity to change to disappear after ten minutes.  Games also have to be filtered by time, once a game has started then put has Started in the box.  Use the strftime to capture times of the game and compare it to current time.

	 Picks page - either home page or tab page but will be Matchups/Index - on this page will need the Selection Form.

	 Search Page - This is where they can search win % by category and then fade/follow people.  Need the Tag form here.

	 Display page - This is where all User data will be displayed.  Data about themselves and data on the people they fade/follow.  Look for hot picks

	 What is the value of this to the amateur sports bettor?  The data collection side has to be fun and then the database side will be of ranked amateur sports bettors that can be searched.  Hot and Cold should be options and also provide the overall win% for that category.  Only show the outlier %'s.  So on the filter there is a HOT and COLD filter where you can show the outliers of the category, the default is all.  HOT - COLD - ALL.  From their you can create your daily fade and follows.  The consensus should be looked at every few days and you should switch bettors in and out.  Completely adjustable, so need to give them space on their feed page to do this (delete tags).  Here's the problem.  Need people to want to use this.  Need them to want to be ranked.  Ranked how?  In each category and overall.  What am I getting as an amateur sports bettor?  Access to a database of sportsbettors.  Where you get to fade/follow the hottest and coldest bettors for any category then you get the break down of each game in your feed.  Format:

	 TB(NFL)      - 5.5     NO(NFL)

	 7 followers            1 follower
	 2 faders               8 faders

	  

Have the games grouped by sport and then at the bottom have their hot picks, reccomended picks.  How can I keep track of those picks?  Will everyone just be on the same bettors?  Most likely but so what, if it works it works.  Will it work is the question.  Will this put people on a more profitable path than standard handicapping practices.  It feels like yes to me.  Have to sell others on it.  Why standard handicapping practices fail.  What is the value here?  The database of bettors and the access to it.  Maybe can sell that to people who want to use the product, but the product would need 500 - 1000 handicappers using it.  That's the obstacle.  Is there value here?  The market is hot and you are seeing more and more the term "community platform" in the description of products in this space yet no one is really doing a community based handicapping strategy.  No one is doing this.  No one has been able to get sports bettors there on a steady basis.  Social media cant be the place you start.  Have to start grass roots.  In the online forums and at the sportsbooks once they open but people are not gonna want to be approached by a stranger.  That's the problem.  Have to figure out how to get the people there.
