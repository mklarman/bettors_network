Comments will need to be made on the Post show page.  That's where comments will show and be filled out.

Posts will be generated on the focused page of the conetent: NFL, NBA, LINE MOVEMENTS, General, etc.  There will be a page where the user can select their subject, then they go to the subject's designated page where we can see the thread titles, but also here they can create a new post.

Probes will be shown on the Matchup/edit, Selections on Matchup show.  Two different pages.  Both pages list the active matchups as links.  User clicks on a matchup and then has the option.  On the probe page, have an admin if statement that can show the matchup and allow it to be edited.
